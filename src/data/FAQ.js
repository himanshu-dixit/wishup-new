        answer: `
            <p>
                Each of our plans include a dedicated virtual assistant (VA). You will work with your VA on a one-to-one basis, continually submitting tasks directly to this person. Your VA will grow to know you, your work, and your preferences—all while learning to anticipate your needs without you having to repeat yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a collaborative consumption business, our VAs are a shared resource among clients. They schedule their days to best serve you and your incoming tasks with priority and without delay. As such, we do not offer immediate turnaround, though we expect most tasking to be completed in 24-48 hours. We encourage you to place priority levels and deadlines on your projects.

        answer: `
            <p>
                All of our VAs are located in the United States and you'll work with an assistant in the timezone of your preference: East Coast or West Coast. Do you live outside the U.S.? No worries! We currently have clients in over 60 countries and can happily support your needs—wherever you are. Please be aware that your VA will be working from their U.S. time zone (EST/PST) when completing your tasks.

            <p>
                First, welcome aboard! We will begin locating the best possible VA for you using the information you shared during the signup process about your working style and personal preferences. After we’ve determined who would be the best fit for your needs—we’ll send an email connecting the two of you! We suggest hopping on a quick call soon after. We aim to introduce you to your VA within two business days of signing up.

        heading: "Do my hours roll over?",
        answer: `
            <p>
                As a monthly membership service, our clients subscribe to us for the ability to retain a U.S.-based virtual assistant. While each plan offers a different level of service, as a membership subscription our plan hours do not rollover, and your membership fees are not tied to time specifically.

        heading: "What is the Branded Email feature?",
        answer: `
            <p>
                Branded Email is a little addition that makes a huge difference. This feature allows your dedicated VA to send and receive emails from your domain instead of their @zirtual.startups.co address. This adds a level of professionalism and gives the appearance that your assistant is in-house when desired. Your tech team or webmaster should be able to assist you in generating a new email for your VA. Depending on your domain carrier a small fee may be required to create a new email address. Zirtual is not responsible for fees incurred with branded email setup.

        heading: "Will my VA be working on the weekend?",
        answer: `
            <p>
                Our VAs work standard business hours, Monday through Friday and are not required or expected to work on weekends or after 6 p.m. You can submit your tasks anytime, day or night, weekday or weekend. If submitted before/after business hours, your VA will receive the task(s) the following business day to begin working on them. We do want to note that if you send a task minutes before the workday ends, it is unlikely to be completed that same day.

        heading: "Can my VA handle scheduling?",
        answer: `
            <p>
                Absolutely. Your VA can coordinate meetings, schedule appointments, and manage your Google Calendar with ease. Simply share and grant your VA access to manage your calendar. It is that simple!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our VAs exclusively use and manage Google Calendars. At this time we cannot guarantee support for Outlook, iCal, or other calendar applications, though we will do our best to accommodate your needs.

            <p>
                Yes! Your VA can place orders, make purchases, and schedule payments safely and securely. You can read more about our security measures and policies here. To share credit card information, passwords, and other sensitive data, simply have your VA collect your information over the phone. This way, we can ensure your information remains safe. At Zirtual, we are committed to the security of your account!

            <p>
                They sure can but with some limitations. Your VA is happy to contact vendors, make reservations, and place phone calls for you but they cannot make sales or prospecting calls to solicit customers.

                Yes and no. Every VA will be accessible to you by phone. However, this line is available for your convenience alone. Your VA cannot accept calls from contacts, vendors, or service providers on your behalf.

            <p>
                They can! Delegating your Gmail inbox to your VA to read, send, and delete messages on your behalf is a great way to stay on top of email and keep your inbox tidy.
            </p>
            <p>
                VAs work exclusively out of Gmail and cannot guarantee support for Outlook, Mail, or other mail clients, though we will do our best to accommodate your needs.

                They sure can. Your VA can use Google Presentations to format and edit personal or business presentations with your provided content, images and detailed instructions.

                All of our VAs go through a rigorous certification process so that they can best serve you from day one. While we do not offer specific training for specialized software, our VAs are more than happy to assist if you are able to provide instruction. Please note that we are unable to provide support for any software requiring local desktop download.

                Your VA will happily find you an excellent bookkeeper or CPA. However, due to certain legalities and a specific knowledge of the domain, VAs are unable to provide assistance with Quickbooks or other accounting tools.

                Your VA can certainly research and vet qualified freelancers or graphic design agencies. However, as talented as your VA is, they cannot personally provide assistance with design projects.
