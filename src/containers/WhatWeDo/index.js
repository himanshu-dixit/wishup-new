                                    Zirtual provides US-Based, college educated virtual assistants to busy people everywhere, but just what is a virtual assistant, and how does the role compare to traditional “in office” titles?

                                    There are many titles that provide the same functions, and there are some titles that focus on more specialized or specific needs. When you see titles such as Admin Assistant, Professional Assistant, Virtual Administrative Assistant, Online Administrative Assistant, Virtual Office Assistant and Remote Assistant, they are all just different names for the same role.

                                    However, titles such as Remote Office Manager, Virtual Secretary, Virtual Paralegal, Virtual Receptionist, and Online Project Manager, usually indicate much more specific and specialized areas of expertise and service.
